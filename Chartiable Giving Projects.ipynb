    "From the regression results and table 2a, we can see the positive effect of using matched donations. From regression, match ratio 2:1 increases 0.19% response rate compared to match ratio 1:1 and match ratio 3:1 increases 0.01% response rate compared to match ratio 2:1. Similarly, from table 2a, match ratio 2:1 increases 0.02% response rate compared to match ratio 1:1 and match ratio 3:1 has same response rate with match ratio 2:1. However, we can tell from the number that the increase from match ration 2:1 to 3:1 is smaller than match ratio 1:1 to 2:1. Thus, though the effects are all positive, we should choose match ratio 2:1 to weigh the cost. "

    "Since states are not randomly assigned, difference in culture, politics, demographic exist. Thus, the difference may counfound the treatment and response rate.

Similarly, we also can't conclude the difference in the treatment effect between two states has a causal effect on response rate.

On the other hand, people in blue states can't feed themselves not even to say making donation."

    "**Question 2. Next, regress dollars given on a treatment dummy and an intercept, but base the regression only on respondents that made a donation (i.e. donation dummy is equal to 1). This regression allows you to analyze how much respondents donate conditional on donating some positive amount. Interpret the regression coefficients. Does the treatment coefficient have a causal interpretation?**\n",

    "The treatment coefficient doesn't have a causal effect on donation money because of selection bias. In this exercise, we only pick people donate money, so the decision to donate is not random. The donation amount can also be affected by people's living condition. For instance, people in the treatment group may be poorer than people in control group, so they donate less money. This kind of factor may confound the result. Thus, the treatment coefficient lacks a causal interpretation."
